# BCGX-GenAI-Job-Simulation
A collection of projects from the BCG GenAI Job Simulation. Includes development of a rule-based AI financial chatbot and financial data analysis projects using Python and pandas to simplify and communicate insights from complex 10-K/10-Q reports.
## Total Overview
This repository showcases my work during the BCG X GenAI Job Simulation (October 2025). The tasks focused on leveraging AI and Python for financial data analysis and chatbot development.
### Task 1
Analyze financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports, extract key metrics, and present insights in a structured format. 
### Task 2
Develop a rule-based AI financial chatbot that interprets financial information extracted in task 1 and communicates it clearly to users, integrated with a web interface using Flask. 
## Features
* Python-based data manipulation using pandas.
* Rule-based logic for generating financial insights.
* Integration of complex datasets (revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, cash flows).
* Chatbot interaction design for clear, user-friendly financial communication.

## Main Purpose
To simplify complex financial data, making it interactive, accessible, and insightful for users interested in financial analysis.

## Outcome
* Gained practical experience in Python and data analysis.
* Built a functional AI chatbot capable of summarizing financial statements.
* Learned to present financial insights clearly and interactively.

## How to run
* 1: Clone the repository
* 2: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
* 3: Install dependencies (Pandas & Flask)
* 4: Run the Flask app
* 5: Open your browser: Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 and there you go, ask anything!
